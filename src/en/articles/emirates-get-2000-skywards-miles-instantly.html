                <h2 class="mt-48 mb-24">Emirates Belgium</h2>
                <p class="mb-24">Emirates has been operating two daily flights a week between Brussels and Dubai for 9 years. It is the largest international airline in the world currently serving more than 140 destinations. It connects six continents through its modern hub in Dubai and operates one of the most modern and efficient airline fleets, consisting of Airbus A380 and Boeing 777, facilitating global trade and passenger traffic. Thanks to its diverse and multicultural workforce, Emirates responds to its customers' needs by offering innovative and high-quality in-flight services. The airline also supports local communities around the world through its international sports and cultural sponsorships. Since its inception, the airline has been recognized with more than 500 international awards for its operational excellence, innovative services, catering, entertainment (with its 6.500 channels) and industry-leading products. All this makes Emirates one of the most recognized airlines in the world.</p>

                <h2 class="mt-48 mb-24">Emirates First Class</h2>
                <p class="mb-24">Experience true luxury with your own private hotel room in the sky. Game changing technology includes temperature controls and mood lighting, an industry first with virtual windows, and soft leather seating reminiscent of a Mercedes-Benz S-Class. Whether you’re flying on the Emirates A380 or our game‑changing Boeing 777, you’ll experience the World’s Best First Class 2020.</p>

                <h2 class="mt-48 mb-24">Emirates Business Class</h2>

                <h2 class="mt-48 mb-24">Emirates Premium Economy</h2>
                <p class="mb-24">The new cabin class, which offers luxurious seats, more legroom, and a service to rival many airlines’ business offering, will be available to Emirates customers travelling on popular A380 routes to London, Paris, Sydney, and Christchurch from December.<br><br>
                  Emirates is the only airline in the region to offer a Premium Economy cabin.<br><br>
                  Emirates Premium Economy will be exceptional in its class, with minute attention given to every aspect of the customer experience. Customers trading up from Economy will be getting excellent value.<br><br>
                  Emirates currently have six A380s equipped with this cabin class, which limits the initial deployment, but the intention is to offer this experience to many more markets across the network. This November, Emirates will begin their retrofit programme to install Premium Economy on 67 A380s and 53 Boeing 777s. At the end of the programme, Emirates will have 126 aircraft fitted out with Premium Economy cabins, as well as the latest interiors across other cabins. It is a major investment to ensure our customers continue to have the best experience in the sky.”<br><br>
                  Emirates Premium Economy is in a class of its own, offering a signature experience unmatched in the industry.
